Part A------------------------------

Part A consists of a volcanic island inside a skybox.  The skybox is an inverted view of earth.

There are many controls you can manipulate in this scene.  These controls include setting the height of the terrain, setting the max height (so you can have a plataeu of sorts), and manipulating the water's swell and height.  

The slider on mixFactor1 is my most favorite gui use.  I recommend you use it and see the effect.  

****I went for the extra credit and added a fresnel effect to the water.  You can play with the fresnel settings, too.




Part B-------------------------------

For Part B, I did a particle system based on a tornado.

In this scene, you can control the radius and speed of the tornado, cause turbulence, add noise to the particles, and you can make the tornado move from left to right as well.  By default, these noise functions are turned off, so you will have to slide them to see the effects.  

I used a 3D noise from the noise functions we were given on the PDF document for HW2.

****I went for the extra credit and added a point sprite texture to the particle system.  The texture is a cloud jpg image, and you can see the image if you zoom in enough.
